# MS Excel Projects and Case Studies
This repository showcases two data analysis projects focused on deriving actionable insights into property pricing and market trends. Both projects use MS Excel for data cleaning, manipulation, and exploratory data analysis, demonstrating how structured data analysis can address real-world business challenges in the real estate and short-term rental domains.

## Project 1: Real Broker Housing Price Analysis

Evaluated macroeconomic factors and their potential influence on housing prices.

### Techniques and Tools Used:
Data Cleaning and Standardization
Pivot Tables for summary statistics and grouping analysis
VLOOKUPs for linking datasets
Temporal trend analysis using MS Excel

### Business Outcome:
The analysis provides Real Broker with actionable recommendations for pricing properties effectively based on location, features, and market trends.

## Project 2: Airbnb Pricing Optimization Analysis

Explored trends in property prices based on cleaning fees and demand patterns.
Utilized log-transformed price data to capture pricing trends and distributions effectively.

### Techniques and Tools Used:
Data Cleaning and Validation
Pivot Tables for feature analysis and aggregation
VLOOKUPs for data integration and enrichment
Statistical summaries and feature-based comparisons using MS Excel

### Business Outcome:
This project offers Airbnb a comprehensive understanding of price drivers, enabling dynamic pricing adjustments to maximize commissions and improve competitiveness.
